I am a rising fifth-year economics PhD student at [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/). My current research interests are urban and spatial economics, macroeconomics, and labor economics. You can contact me [here](me2713@columbia.edu).

Prior to coming to Columbia, I graduated from Pennsylvania State University and was a senior research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
