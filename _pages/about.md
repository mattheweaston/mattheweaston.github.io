I am a third-year economics PhD student at Columbia University. 

My current research interests are international trade, macroeconomics, and political economy. To see my research, check out my [Research](https://mattheweaston.github.io/research/) page.

Prior to coming to Columbia, I graduated from Pennsylvania State University and was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. To see my CV, see my [CV](https://mattheweaston.github.io/cv/) page.
