I am a fourth-year economics PhD student at [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My current research interests are urban and spatial economics, macroeconomics, and labor economics. 

Prior to coming to Columbia, I graduated from Pennsylvania State University and was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
