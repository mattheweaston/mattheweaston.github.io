		The authors revisit Ben Bernanke’s global saving glut (GSG) hypothesis from 2005—which links low long-term real interest rates in the United States to excess saving in a number of non-Western countries, including, but not limited to, China. Using an analytical framework and empirical data, they find that the ability of the GSG hypothesis to explain the fall in long-term real rates between 2002 and 2006 is likely much greater than its ability to account for the further fall in these rates from the Great Recession onward.

		Markets for collateralized risky loans clear on two dimensions - an interest rate (or a spread above the riskless rate) and a specification of the amount of collateral per dollar of lending. The latter is summarized by the margin or "haircut" associated with the loan. Although data from the bilateral repo market suggest that interest spreads move far less than margins, particularly in financial crises, the theory of collateral equilibrium with continuous belief distributions and realistically high leverage ratios has exactly the opposite implication.
